# casting-numbers


This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates implicit and explicit casting between variables of different data types. The project demonstrates how conversions between data types happen and when explicit casting should be used.

Operation
The program performs the following operations:

Implicitly cast from smaller data types to larger data types.
Explicitly cast from larger data types to smaller data types.
Demonstrates when explicit casting should be used to avoid data loss.
